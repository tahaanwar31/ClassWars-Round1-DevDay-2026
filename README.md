## At a Glance

Class Wars is a **two-round competitive programming and strategy platform** built for a live university coding competition. Teams compete through a multi-level trivia round covering OOP, data structures, and algorithms, followed by a unique **Tank Warfare** coding challenge where players write C++ code to navigate, fight, and defeat a boss — all compiled server-side in real time. The platform features a full admin dashboard, combined leaderboards, time-based round access, and server-side C++ compilation via the OneCompiler API — all designed and deployed within a tight competition timeline.

---

## Key Features

### Competition Engine
- **Two-round format** — Round 1 (Trivia Gauntlet) + Round 2 (Tank Warfare Coding Challenge)
- **Time-based access control** — Countdown timers and configurable play windows restrict when each round goes live
- **Real-time combined leaderboard** — Merges scores from both rounds into unified team rankings
- **Team-based authentication** — Teams register and compete as units, not individuals

### Round 1: Trivia Gauntlet
- **10 progressive difficulty levels** with 50 questions per level (500 total)
- **3 question types:**
  - **MCQ** — Multiple choice with 4 options
  - **One-Word** — Free-text single-word answers (case-insensitive matching)
  - **Output Prediction** — Predict the output of a given code snippet
- **Level-up rule:** Clear Level N by answering N questions correctly (Level 1 = 1 correct, Level 2 = 2 correct, ... Level 10 = 10 correct)
- **Demotion mechanic:** 2 consecutive wrong answers or timeouts drops you back one level — stay sharp
- **Scoring:** 5 points per correct answer; rankings determined by highest level reached, then speed of progression

### Round 2: Tank Warfare (The Signature Feature)
- Players write **real C++ code** using OOP concepts — classes, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, composition, and memory management
- Code is **compiled and executed server-side** via the OneCompiler API, then the output drives the game
- **3 progressive levels testing different OOP concepts:**
  - **Level 1 — Checkpoint Run (Inheritance):** Navigate a tank through 9 checkpoints in sequence on a 10x10 grid. Override `move()`, `attack()`, and `defend()` from a `Tank` base class. Print `STEP:<row>,<col>` commands to move the tank cell-by-cell
  - **Level 2 — Combat Purge (Inheritance + Game Loop):** Destroy 8 enemy tanks on a 10x10 grid. Use a built-in `fire(row, col)` function with strict 2-cell lock range — must be on the same row, exactly 2 cells to the left of the target. Combines movement logic with tactical positioning
  - **Level 3 — Operation Square One (Boss Fight):** Defeat General Makarov (10 HP) who patrols a square perimeter. The player has only 2 HP. Tests **abstraction** (`Weapon` base class), **polymorphism** (`LaserGun` vs `Cannon` — laser penetrates shields, cannon deals damage to unshielded boss), **aggregation** (`Radar*` pointer), **composition** (owning and deleting `Weapon*`), and **memory management** (`new`/`delete` lifecycle)
- **Scoring:** 10 points per level completed (30 max for Round 2)

### Admin Dashboard
- **Real-time competition statistics** — Active sessions, completion rates, top performers, average scores
- **Question bank management** — Full CRUD across all levels and question types
- **Team management** — Create, monitor, and manage competing teams
- **Game configuration** — Enable/disable rounds, set play windows, define competition rules
- **Session monitoring** — Track live game sessions and player progress

### Developer Experience
- **CodeMirror C++ editor** — In-browser IDE with syntax highlighting, dark tactical theme, and smart indentation
- **Responsive UI** — Tailwind CSS + Framer Motion animations for a polished competition experience
- **Automated seeding** — Scripts to populate question banks, configure levels, and set up the competition

## How It Works — Tank Warfare (Round 2)

This is the standout feature of Class Wars. Here's the full pipeline:

```
Player writes C++ code (class MyTank, LaserGun, Cannon, etc.)
        │
        ▼
Code sent to backend ──► Prepended with game harness ──► Compiled via OneCompiler API
        │
        ▼
Compiler returns stdout (STEP, FIRE, SHIELD, FINISH_REACHED commands)
        │
        ▼
Frontend parses output line-by-line ──► Animates tank on 10x10 grid
        │
        ▼
Win/loss determined client-side (checkpoints visited, enemies destroyed, boss HP)
        │
        ▼
Score reported to backend on level completion
```

### Level 3: Boss Fight in Detail

The most technically demanding level tests five OOP concepts simultaneously:

| OOP Concept | How It's Tested |
|-------------|----------------|
| **Inheritance** | `MyTank : public Tank` with pure virtual overrides |
| **Abstraction** | `Weapon` abstract base class with virtual `fire()` |
| **Polymorphism** | `LaserGun::fire()` prints `FIRE:LASER`, `Cannon::fire()` prints `FIRE:CANNON` |
| **Aggregation** | `Radar*` pointer — used but not owned/deleted |
| **Composition + Memory Management** | `Weapon*` — allocated with `new`, must be `delete`d each turn |

The boss patrols a square path and cycles through 4 states:
- **Facing right (shielded):** Only `LASER` penetrates — `CANNON` deals 0 damage
- **Facing down (open):** `CANNON` deals 1 HP damage
- **Facing left (fires at player):** Player must print `SHIELD` or take 1 HP damage
- **Facing up (open):** `CANNON` deals 1 HP damage

## Scoring System

### Round 1 — Trivia Gauntlet
- **5 points** per correct answer
- **Rankings by:** Highest level reached (primary) > Speed of progression (tiebreak)

### Round 2 — Tank Warfare
- **10 points** per level completed
- **Max Round 2 score:** 30 points (3 levels)

### Combined Leaderboard
Merges Round 1 and Round 2 scores into unified team rankings.
